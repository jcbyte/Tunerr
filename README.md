# Tunerr

Tunerr is a simple web app that lets you create shared rooms where invited friends can control your spotify playback (skip, pause and play), perfect for when your hanging out and playing music without needing to pass your phone around.

**Note:** This app uses the spotify API which requires spotify premium for most functionality.

_This is my first project developed using React._
